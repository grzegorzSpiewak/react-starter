# Tutorial 1: Create a component

- create a new container component called "SampleForm"
(eg. src/frontend/containers/SampleForm/)
- we'll use the same pattern here, of coupling a "stateful" component (state.js) with a "pure" component (index.js)
- the SampleForm component renders a form, with:
  - a text input
  - a checkbox
  - a button
- the button is disabled by default, and only becomes enabled when the text input has a value *and* the checkbox is checked.
- when the button is clicked it should be hidden, and a "Submitting..." message displayed in its place.
- set up the stateful component with presets, like I've shown in the example. There should be enough presets that you can switch between all possible UI outcomes.
- don't worry about making the buttons actually work when you click them, or making the text input do something with the onChange event. We'll get to that next. First, get it working just by switching between state presets.
