# Tutorial 1: Create a component

Introduction to tutorial 1: https://youtu.be/WsB4tdaZYBg

## Your task

- create a new container component called "SampleForm" (eg. `src/frontend/containers/SampleForm/`)
- we'll use the same pattern here, of coupling a "stateful" component (`state.js`) with a "pure" component (`index.js`)
- the `SampleForm` component renders a form, with:
  - a text input
  - a checkbox
  - a button
- the button is disabled by default, and only becomes enabled when the text input has a value *and* the checkbox is checked.
- handle the case of an in-progress submit. In this case, hide the button and display a "Submitting..." message in its place.
- set up the stateful component with presets, like I've shown in the intro video. There should be enough presets that you can switch between all possible UI outcomes.
- don't worry about making the buttons actually work when you click them, or making the text input do something with the `onChange` event. We'll get to that next. First, get it working just by switching between state presets.
