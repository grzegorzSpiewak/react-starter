# Tutorial 2: User interactions

- where we left off in [Tutorial 1](./1.md) we had a form that was not interactive, but that we could toggle by switching state presets. Now it's time to add the interactivity.

- when dealing with pure components, remember that the component should only be concerned with how to display the data, not how to interact with it. So find a way to define callbacks in the stateful component, and pass them into the pure component.
  - when the callback is called, the stateful component has the job of deciding how to update the state.

- add callbacks to handle changes for:
  - typing in the text input
  - toggling the checkbox
  - clicking the submit button

- make sure all of the UI behavior defined in tutorial 1 works interactively.

**bonus round**

- for bonus points: the text input should only allow numbers. If you try to type a non-numeric character into the input, nothing happens.
