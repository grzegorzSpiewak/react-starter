# react-starter

In this series of tutorials we're going to be starting with a pretty blank slate, and gradually adding new things to build a UI with react.  Hopefully by the time it comes to add the kitchen sink, you'll have a good idea of why we need it :)

## Install

```
npm install

## Build frontend

```
npm run packs:build
npm run build -- -w &
open index.html
