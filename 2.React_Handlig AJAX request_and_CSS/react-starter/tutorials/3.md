# Tutorial 3: CSS

In this tutorial we'll be building on top of the interactive form we created in [Tutorial 2](./2.md) and adding some CSS.

We'll use the `cmz` package to create some modular composeable classes and apply them to the components.

## Set up

If you already completed Tutorial 2 you can continue from there. Otherwise you can use the `tutorial-2-end` branch as a starting point:

```
git checkout origin tutorial-2-end
```

Next install the `cmz` package:

```
npm i -S cmz
```

If you haven't used `cmz` before, here's a guided tour: https://youtu.be/5GZ2Moor4V4

## Your task

This one is mostly a "free play" tutorial. Some things you might like to try:

- create some general CSS modules in `src/frontend/styles.js`
- compose them in `src/frontend/components/SubmitButton.js`
- [create an issue](https://github.com/joshwnj/react-starter/issues/new) and show me what you came up with :)

## Questions

Remember to [ask questions](https://github.com/joshwnj/react-starter/issues/new) if you're not sure about what something means or why I've chosen to do things a certain way.
